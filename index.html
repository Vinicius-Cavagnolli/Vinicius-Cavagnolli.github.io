                    <p>We shall start in a not-so-far future, where life in society has become so deprecated, obsolete,
                        obliterated by its own self, that the scenario left behind is pure nothingness. The empty alone
                        sand took place all over the grass. Here and there: signals of life trials, soon to get its
                        hopes diminished to zero. Here and there: hides some little town, once referred as influential,
                        not nowadays.</p>
                    <p>I shall mention one of them as basis to this narrative. It has no name, some habitants, lots of
                        creepy things going on. It is structured as a church, a bar, no school, a cemetery, a doctor, no
                        rules, no law. This emptiness of here is matched by the intellect of those who inhabit it. They
                        don’t seem to be looking for change. Kept this way for not losing the naturally rational spirit
                        state of properly being human.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">II</h2>
                    <p>Between dead builds, crushed by the weight of time, lies a spark of adrenaline that is followed
                        by those whose souls are brave and death-fearless. The chosen ones happened to be three
                        middle-aged humans. Whose punk spirit overcame all fears and warning signs.</p>
                    <p>So both the girls and the dude entered a reality they would not come back ever from. Then he
                        discovered… Pleasure!? What shall be the most addicting specie of feeling in our whole history.
                        Inside the old house with creaking wood floors, a book was found, in its inside: images of gore,
                        so horribly brutal, violent, blood-filled, hypnotizing, spectacular, intense and at the same
                        time yet so delicate and meticulously organized, making the mess look so beautifully gross. And
                        in the context of pages, unreadable words. Simply I’m incapable of describing all the magic
                        contained inside the book.</p>
                    <p>Finished with flipping through the pages, he buried it back to original place, not to other two
                        to see. Needless to say the book attracted the girls too, its simple state of being, was enough
                        to call for desire, and that is on what it feeds. The will of having power above it all, to feel
                        invincible.</p>
                    <p>The three smoked their pot, snorted their coke, walked through the day, just as normally as they
                        could. With that voice stuck on mind, ready to attack when weakness enters in. Totally compared
                        to the christian god. Then, time of going home for him, some fun between the girls themselves,
                        then finally the same fate as his.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">III</h2>
                    <p>Bedtime was kind of unusual for him, ice cold dominated his blood, the hypothermia symptoms
                        getting closer and closer. On the other side of town, meaning around four blocks down the
                        street, the girls started kissing, the hot feeling of passion, burning through their lips
                        opposite to his coldness. The hands of her now touching other’s soft skin, and his skin… his
                        skin feeling harder and harder. Then the nails of both opening scars, dripping blood of
                        another’s, feeling so sexually perverse, and his nails… his nails scratching its own eyes to
                        make up the excruciating pain. Girls looking for conquering other’s heart, he seeking to end
                        it
                        all bare-handed, drawing in mind his perfect final act of torning himself apart.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">IV</h2>
                    <p>Morning time used to be meeting time between them. But he no more made himself present.
                        On the old build, tracks of blood on the sand, designing a path from meeting place to
                        the entry, then back from the mansion to disappear. Where he sat last time, only an old
                        book, left aside. Glowing red, so heavy on atmosphere, yet unnoticeable, harmless to the
                        look of the women.</p>
                    <p>Taking care with the toxic waste all over place, girls got tired of waiting and moved on,
                        back to total ignorance, meaning back to normal. Heading to see the doctor, presumably
                        to seek for news of him, maybe an accident, maybe a shot, a fight, normal stuff and
                        whatever.</p>
                    <p>Getting there, hitting the entrance bell, doc came out, inviting them to enter his
                        habitat. At the inside, after some not so informative talk, the destine was home again,
                        hoping for next day. That would be not exist another day.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">V</h2>
                    <p>Doctor told him to leave now, so he would not get in trouble. More than had lying about
                        his condition and location.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">VI</h2>
                    <p>The good news at that time, were still spread mouth-to-mouth. But such small place, such
                        known-to-each-other folks… About two hours is what took for the fact to run across all
                        the village.</p>
                    <p>In the middle of nowhere, every form of life there is idle, actually in a state of
                        non-existence, so it turned really easy to open the heart, one to the other. And I mean,
                        the hearts were really opened, so was the belly from which intestines and viscera
                        slipped out matching perfectly smell from putrefaction with the feces that were blown
                        away and merged with the environment around the bodies, at least four of them, not
                        really countable, unrecognizable, dis-organ-ized now lying lifeless and
                        indistinguishable. Similar to all those others, but no more with pulsating red liquid
                        inside the valves.</p>
                    <p>Their bodies routed, gutted, skinned probably while alive (as possible as they could feel
                        to be), then eyes gouged out. The skin wasn’t found nearby, so the search ended in a few
                        seconds. Now everyone home. Tomorrow is a nice day to try to stay healthy somehow, life
                        keeps going on, the true torture is to be alive those days.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">VII</h2>
                    <p>And the book was still there, now more noticeable. He, who hadn’t had a cover ever
                        before, now have a good and soft one. All designed in human skin. The smell was that of
                        flowers, as sweet as it can be. He was also updated with eyeballs, nose and mouth. The
                        smile was that of bandits finding the true gold. The teeth, red stained, meat pieces
                        between.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">VIII</h2>
                    <p>From behind the dead and pale trees, under a freezing moon, there he lied. Failed
                        repetitive irrational tries to wash his hands with tears and saliva. Decayed in its own
                        misery. Sharpened blades in the form of nails cutting throughout all his temple of sin.
                        The girls still could see, but no longer recognizing the face of an old friend. Truth
                        is, not even the most meticulous observer would know that expression, the sorrow turned
                        his eyes into gray, the structure of face deformed beyond recognition. Both her entrails
                        all over sand. Bodies split in two. Awful vision, and at the same, slightly appreciable.
                        Eyeballs ejected unaffected while seeing own organs collapsing.</p>
                    <p>And he left. Hurt on the inside. Physically more than all. And the day have passed.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">IX</h2>
                    <p>Day two, after the mysterious unsolved massacre, as it should be when considered a
                        massacre.</p>
                    <p>Corpses begun to be buried. The ritual for the human restart, a group moaning latin words
                        unknown to themselves, uncovering the real to enter their fantasies, waiting for the
                        weakness to strike. Falling for their own liberty to choose to fall.</p>
                    <p>The sun rose from the splendorous and scrumptious reveille as the dark took control of
                        the weak minds. God-alike act in its own purity. Deciding the fate of town in the jiff
                        of thousandths of seconds. The logic acts pretty stupid sometimes.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">X</h2>
                    <p>End of gathering phase. Moved to the point where the ancient book was left. Shivering with ease,
                        he started spelling what now became understandable. Casting the spell under the night of full
                        moon. Astonishingly freezing winds took place to match the moonlight. Sounds of cracking bones
                        coming from the ground to decorate the atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>And the corpses started rising, and the old witchcraft book opening a huge perverse smile. And
                        hungry smell feeling the air. Chocking the pure oxygen, smashing each atom of freshness from the
                        air.</p>
                    <p>Each dead-alive not to obey to anyone, searching for flesh.</p>
                    <p>Vision caused repentance to him, sentiment of self-pity noticing the overwhelming decadence that
                        flew at his thoughts. Human reactions consumed him, the automatic action of running away like a
                        baby child creep out by the boogie man. It just penetrated into his despicable mind.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">XI</h2>
                    <p>And he ran.</p>
                    <p>The apocalypse, real hell, revived by him, blind by the promises of an old witches’ bible.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">XII</h2>
                    <p>Hiding in the depths of existence, down the basement of the house, he once felt powerless, devoid
                        of hope.</p>
                    <p>Eyes wide shut in the dimness of fear, black was the only light and silence the loudest clatter
                        ever heard. At the times they lived, silence was such a sore, grievous act of singsonging.</p>
                    <p>At some points, some screams far away are heard here and there.</p>
                    <p>Grisly creatures taking the whole place. Nowhere to run, except the desert around the town. Life
                        ended by the desire of discovering, by the desire of understanding what the book meant in its
                        lines. To seek the knowledge obliterated the life.</p>
                    <p>It is known that the desire of solving the mysteries have always systematically reformed each
                        society. Each way of living dismembered and reworked for wisdom reaching. When finding what you
                        are not supposed to discover, you can safely break the constant process of failing produced by
                        the system systematic flux. Then, the bad news are finding out you do make part of the routine
                        you are into.</p>
                    <p>To end what you belong to, implies in ending yourself. No victory is worth without
                        self-sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>Deep within himself, he knew the end was one. Only one. But as the human being is totally
                        worthless to try to spell out, he ran away.</p>

                    <h2 class="page-header">XIII</h2>
                    <p>Fighting for his miserable state of being, he went out of the house to look for anything sharper
                        and deadlier than naked hands. As usual, the town in the middle of nowhere had nothing. Total
                        numbness.</p>
                    <p>Brain flooded with adrenaline mixed with the infamous terrifying fear of dying. Common to mankind
                        on this situations, he head to the church. The final spark of hope. Asking for whom you never
                        cared about once. Someone who was shaped by others to enter your brain and bravely you staunchly
                        believed to be the owner of yourself and free of his prison, but failed to stay sane, losing the
                        fight against your own ideals.</p>
                    <p>And he passed through the big wood double doors. And he fell on knees. The torturing sound of
                        tortured souls getting closer to him. The horde approaching.</p>
                    <p>He begun to pray. He never ended the request for suffering, the will of staying alive to end it
                        slowly. If there is a good and lawful god, he acted upon him. Gave as a gift of his courage, a
                        fast end. No need to live waiting for death. The end of all.</p>
                    <p>As the seconds passed, more and more civilized dead-alives started sharing his guts. Perfectly
                        diving the parts, to each one feast upon him, equally to the others. They had no hate between
                        themselves, no avarice, no envy, no greed. Each of them were equal and would starve to death
                        instead of leaving a friend unattended.</p>
                    <p>All were happy, nonetheless.</p>
                    <p>He, the savior. Never to be found or remembered. A truly fantastic final to a not so fantastic
                        form of life.</p>
